Hi, I'm Aditya ðŸ‘‹
Quantitative finance professional with 2+ yearsâ€™ experience applying Python, machine learning, and statistical modelling to develop and backtest systematic trading strategies. Skilled at combining data-driven research with market intuition to generate actionable signals.

Current focus:

- Backtesting equity, fixed income, and statistical arbitrage strategies
