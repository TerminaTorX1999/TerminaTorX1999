Hi, I’m Aditya 👋, a quantitative finance professional with 2+ years’ experience applying Python, machine learning, and statistical modeling to develop and backtest systematic trading strategies. I combine an engineering background, MSc in Finance & Investment, and CFA Level I clearance with hands-on experience in SQL-to-Python pipelines, feature engineering, and quantitative research.

Current focus:

Backtesting equity, fixed income, and statistical arbitrage strategies

Yield curve modeling & portfolio duration optimization

Macro-driven machine learning forecasting models

Currently working as an Analyst, where I build and refine trading strategies, automate research workflows, and integrate macroeconomic insights into systematic approaches. Outside of work, I explore new strategy ideas and publish selected projects here.

Passionate about turning market data into robust, actionable strategies that can inform trading decisions and portfolio construction.
